    <p>For the past ten years, I have fought for quality education and good paying jobs for my constituents. I am proud to serve on the House Education committee where I’ve been an advocate for our teachers and students. Prior to venturing into public service, I had the privilege of serving as a physician for over 35 years in Henderson where I helped to found the Mom’s Clinic for our most needy citizens. I hope to continue to improve our medical system which is why I am honored to serve as Vice Chairman of the Health and Welfare committee of the State House.</p>
    <p>My wife, Peggy, and I are blessed with three sons and four grandchildren. I’m lucky to be a native of Henderson where we have lived since graduating from college. I attended Western Kentucky University and taught at the Henderson Community College before venturing into medicine and attending the University of Louisville School of Medicine.</p>
    <p>I hope you will join me as I fight to make sure Kentucky remains a beautiful, healthy place to live and work, not only for us but for our children and grandchildren. </p>
